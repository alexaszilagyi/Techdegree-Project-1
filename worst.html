        <h2>My Worst Coding Experience</h2>
        <p>Shortly after I began my first "big-kid" job out of college, the company I worked for was approached to create a simple website. It's not a common service we offer, but since the job appeared "simple," my boss asked if it was something I could do. As I had taken two responsive web design courses in college (the only two web courses my college offered) I agreed and said I was up to the challenge. (We all know where this is going.)</p>
        <p>My first mistake was sorely underestimating how long it would take me to build the site. I think I quoted 3-5 hours, which would make more sense for my skillset now. I, of course, ran into a snag. No matter how hard I tried, I couldn't get the site to mimic the functonality of my mockup. It quickly became obvious to me that I bit far more off than I could chew, but now I had to figure a way out of this. There was an actual client waiting for a finished product, afterall.</p>
        <p>In a last-ditch effort, I reached out to my web professor in college. And PHEW, HE BAILED ME OUT. He helped me fix the website to function the way I had wanted and I was able to deliver the finished product to the client. I, of course, took him out to lunch afterwards as a "thank you."</p>
        <h3>Moral of the Story:</h3>
        <ul class="morals">
          <li>When quoting time, <em>be honest with yourself</em>; take your skillset into consideration and, when in doubt, add an extra couple hours.</li>
          <li>If you get stuck, set a time limit and <em>ask for help</em> if you can't find a solution within that time period. Reach out to your peers, post in forums, etc.</li>
          <li><em>It's okay to say "no."</em> I put a lot of pressure on myself to "prove" myself to my new employer and took on the job. It would have totally been okay (and in this case, more ideal) if I had just said, "I can't take on that project â€“ I feel it is beyond my ability at this point in time." Knowing yourself is an incredibly valuable tool (and can keep you from appearing foolish).</li>
