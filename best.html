        <h2>My Best Coding Experience</h2>
        <p>This experience isn't a professional one, but a personal revelation.</p>
        <p>In April 2014, I found Treehouse. I signed up for the basic account, and as time allowed, I took the Web Design course. As I mentioned in my <a href="worst.html">Worst Coding Experience</a>, I had taken two responsive web design courses in college, but there were some concepts I just wasn't grasping.</p>
        <p>It didn't take long for me to realize joining Treehouse was an invaluable step for me. The concepts I didn't understand in college, I was understanding now. I noticed I was much faster at coding landing pages for internal use at work, and my confidence with writing code was increasing.</p>
        <p>I started to wonder "why." Why was I able to grasp concepts in a few months with Treehouse that I didn't understand in a year at college? After some thought, I figured it out:</p>
        <ul class="morals">
          <li>With Treehouse,<em> I was learning on my time.</em> In college, I had 5 classes per semester, which meant my focus was being pulled in at least 5 different directions. Yes, I was working full-time (as I still am), but I got to leave work at work which freed up time and energy to focus on learning code.</li>
          <li><em>I was learning at my pace.</em> When I couldn't figure something out, I could pause the Treehouse video I was watching to search for and read supplemental information. Please note, I don't hold this against my web professor in college; he made himself as available to us students as possible, but the bottom line was that he had a curriculum to follow.</li>
          <li><em>Being in control of my education made me feel empowered.</em> Yes, I chose what college to attend, but as I mentioned above, colleges mean curriculums. Schools have to cover a certain amount of information, regardless of the information's relativity to a student's major. With Treehouse, I am completely in control of my education, which makes me feel far more successful and confident in my endeavors.</li>
        </ul>
