        <h2>The Girl Behind the Screen</h2>
        <h3>Aspiring cat lady. Growing web developer. Professional dreamer.</h3>
        <p>I recently entered my fourth year working as a Graphic Production Artist. With a high volume of job requests coming in daily, I work efficiently in Adobe Illustrator and Photoshop to turn projects around quickly. (Key commands are my jam!)</p>
        <p>Having had a passion for code since high school, I work with the Marketing Director and Asst. Creative Director to create web-based marketing collateral. The Asst. Creative Director and I work together to maintain the company's Drupal-based website.</p>
        <p>As I am already familiar with HTML5 and CSS3, I am currently taking courses to learn more about the languages utilized in web development â€“ both front and back end. As a Graphic Designer, I can appreciate the look and feel of a website, but as a future Web Developer I am determined to fully understand how websites work.</p>

        <h2>Goals</h2>
        <p>As I mentioned, I am already familiar with HTML &amp; CSS. I am taking this Treehouse course to learn:</p>
        <ul class="skills">
          <li>how to build solid layouts</li>
          <li>JavaScript</li>
          <li>why people dislike php</li>
          <li>what the heck Ruby/Rails/Python is/does</li>
          <li>when to use a CMS</li>
        </ul>
        <p>I'd like to work for an agency building solid websites for unique and creative customers. (Because who doesn't.) Eventually, I would like to teach code as I think my personality would lend itself well to teaching.</p>
